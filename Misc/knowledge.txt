def update_data():

    data = requests.request.json
    print(data)

Your update_data function has an issue: requests.request.json is incorrect. The requests library is typically used to send HTTP requests, not to handle incoming requests like you would in a web server context (e.g., Flask or Django).

If you're working in a Flask application and want to access JSON data from an incoming POST request, you should use request.get_json() from Flask's request object — not from requests.

Here's how you can fix your function in a Flask context:

✅ Correct Version (Flask):
python
Copy
Edit
from flask import request

def update_data():
    print("Inside post method")

    data = request.get_json()
    print(data)
    return data
